/**:
 
 #isPrime
 
 This function determines whether the given integer parameter is a prime number. A prime number is defined by being a number
 whose only mutliples is 1 and the number itself.
 
 I selected to do this program as I thought it would be fun and I was curious to see how I could design a robust soltion
 
 One variable was defined in this program. It is a boolean value called prime that is returned at the end of the program after determining whether the given number is a prime number
 
 @param: Integer - the number that is going to be checked to determine if the number is a prime number
 @return: Bool - true means that the given number is a prime number and false is that the parameter is not a prime number
 
 Pseudo code/ thinking process:
 
 * want to iterate over all the numbers from 2 to the number - 1
 
 variable prime to store if the number is prime or not
 
 for 2 to the number -1{
 
    for 2 to the number -1{
    
        if the number in the first loop * the index in the second loop is = to the parameter given
        set the variable to false and break out the loop
 
 }
