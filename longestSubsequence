/**:
 
 #longestSubsequence
 
 This function determines the longest consecutive sequence in the given integer array parameter.
  
 I selected to do this program as I thought it would be really fun and challenging. I was curious to see how I could design a robust soltion
 
 Variables defined in the program:
 *var arr: the copy of the parameter array. Did not make it an in&out variable because the example did not have that syntax
 *var currentSeq: integer value of the length of the current sequence of numbers
 *var maxSeq: integer value of the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers
 *var maxIdx: integer value that stores the index of the last number in the longest consecutive sequence of numbers
 *var len: integer value that stores the length of the longest consecutive sequence
 *var sub: integer arr that stores the longest consecutive sequence of numbers
 
 @param: Integer Array - the array that is going to be checked to determine what the longest consecutive subsequence is
 @return: N/A. This function prints out the relavent information
 
 Pseudo code/ thinking process:
 
 arr = a
 sort the arr in assending order - just for convience
 
 integer currentSeq = 1
 integer maxSeq = 0
 
 integer maxIdx = 0
 integer len = 0
 
 integer array sub = [Int]()
 
 for i in 1...arr.count-1{
     
     if there are repeating numbers next to each other{
        continue // skip
     }else if check if index is 1 greater than last
         currentSeq += 1; --> increase the curruntSeq length by 1
     }else { if not reset and hold last sequence value as max
         currentSeq = 1;
     }

     if (currentSeq > maxSeq){ // get the last sequence
         maxSeq = currentSeq; // set the new sequence
         len = maxSeq // update the length of the sequence
         maxIdx = i // update the max index
     }
 }
 
 
 for loop to iterate from the maxIdx - len + 1 to the maxIdx{ --> get the sequence of numbers
     sub.append(arr[i])
 }

 print all the relavent information ie sub and maxSeq
